## Frameworks and Libraries  
- **[GoBigcache](https://github.com/allegro/bigcache)**
  Fast, concurrent, evicting in-memory cache written to keep big number of entries without impact on performance. BigCache keeps entries on heap but omits GC for them. To achieve that, operations on byte slices take place, therefore entries (de)serialization in front of the cache will be needed in most use cases.

- **[Go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis)** 
 This client also works with Kvrocks, a distributed key value NoSQL database that uses RocksDB as storage engine and is compatible with Redis protocol.
